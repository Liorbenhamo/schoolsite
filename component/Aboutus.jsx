          "Once again, we set out on the journey, hand in hand, on a golden
          chain... Today, with excitement and joy, we opened the school year
          5799. First and foremost, I would like to congratulate the students of
          first grade who joined our "Kfar Galim" family this year â€“ they have
          risen and succeeded. Throughout the past year, we have achieved
          incredible accomplishments in various areas: in the national exams, we
          reached the top ten percent in four core subjects. In the field of
          cybersecurity and computer science, we won first place in the national
          cyber championship. We celebrated the seventieth anniversary of our
          country with a historical reenactment of the announcement of the
          establishment of the IDF here at the school, in the presence of the
          Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and IDF champions. In the field of
          physical education, we enjoyed successes, and our trophy cabinet is
          almost full. In the performing arts and music field, we reached new
          heights. Spectacular productions and endless creativity. This year, we
          will continue to deepen our educational activities. During the
          holidays, we are working on setting up a modern and well-equipped
          communication room that will serve the field of communication, as well
          as coding and robotics studies. The staircases on the upper floor of
          first to fourth grade classrooms will be renovated and adapted for a
          different learning experience. At the same time, we will continue to
          strengthen the bond between people, promoting sharing and
          understanding. And I quote the lyrics of Michal Blumfield, words that
          come from the heart and enter the heart: Let's teach our children, the
          science of the heart, For who will teach them compassion, In the land
          of startups and exits, in the land of selfies and WhatsApp, In a
          country of five units, in the land of survival, Let's teach them to
          love, to love street dogs, And not to trample on ants, like before, To
          look into their eyes... to look into their eyes, And not reach for the
          phone every time their heart is touched. Let's teach them poetry,
          let's teach them joy, Because joy hides in a window, and poetry hides
          in the branches of a tree. Let's plant a tree, let's stroke a cat,
          Let's look into the teacher's eyes and say thank you for her
          efforts... In the land of the future, the price tag and the shaming,
          Let's talk about emotions, love, and empathy, so they may see and be
          seen, And learn to be human. Let's rediscover the feeling, let's write
          poems again. I wish you all a wonderful year, finding the similarity
          and the unity within us, A year of harmony, success, and tranquility,
          A year of health, development, and renewal. With love, Dr. Aviv Sigal
          School Principal"
